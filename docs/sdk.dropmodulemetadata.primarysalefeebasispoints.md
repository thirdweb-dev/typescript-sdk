## DropModuleMetadata.primarySaleFeeBasisPoints property

The amount of fees collected on the primary sale, represented as basis points. The default is 0.

For example, if the primary sale is $100 and the primary fee is 1000 BPS, then the primary fee of $10 is distributed to the primary sale recipient.

The destination for this fee is either the project address, or a Splits contract address if it was set using the `setModuleRoyaltyTreasury` method.

1 basis point = 0.01%

For example: if this value is 100, then the royalty is 1% of the total sales.
