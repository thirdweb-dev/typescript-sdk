## Marketplace.setBidBufferBps() method

Set the Bid buffer: this is a percentage (e.g. 5%) in basis points (5% = 500, 100% = 10000). A new bid is considered to be a winning bid only if its bid amount is at least the bid buffer (e.g. 5%) greater than the previous winning bid. This prevents buyers from making very slightly higher bids to win the auctioned items.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
setBidBufferBps(bufferBps: BigNumberish): Promise<void>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  bufferBps | BigNumberish | the bps value |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;void&gt;
